            The scope of work for this project was to restore the wood and fiberglass structure’s watertight integrity. The product specified was
            Kemper Systems 1K-PUR, reinforced polyurethane coating system. This structure consists of a group of parabolic pods, which are clustered
            around a central dome. The result is a structure that resembles the shape of a lotus flower. The first problem to be addressed, were the
            over one thousand linear feet of surface cracks in the FRP outer skin. The cracks were routed and sealed with a single component
            polyurethane caulk.
          </p>
          <p>
            After repairs to all the surface defects were accomplished, the Kemper coating system’s details were installed. This consisted of
            reinforcing the intersection, at any change in plane, with a six inch wide embedded fleece / coating strip. Once the detailing was
            completed, application of the 1K-PUR coating system began. The base system consisted of a primer, a basecoat, reinforcing fleece, a
            saturating coat and a topcoat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since this was a reinforced system, the challenge was to hide the fleece joints to achieve an acceptable aesthetic appearance. Each
            fleece had to be field-fitted to conform to irregular curved shapes. The fleece sheets were butted as tight as possible in order to
            minimize the seams appearance. Once the saturating coat was applied, a six inch wide strip of thinner fleece or joint fleece was applied
            over the butt joints to further mask their appearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final step was to apply two coats of Kemper ColorCoat, a pigmented aliphatic polyurethane coating. The lower and intermediate pods
            were coated with white to serve as a base color for later artistic, air brushed, highlighting. The upper dome portion was coated a custom
            color blue.
