            <img class="service-large" src="/assets/services/structural-concrete-repairs-806b93c27d8e1b59048d67b8aa4ed6f8.jpg" alt=
            "Structural Concrete Repairs">Concrete structures can develop a wide range of problems, caused by a variety of factors. Unlike wine,
            concrete problems do not improve with age. The longer the problem is left, usually, the worst it becomes. A simple repair, in one area,
            can often prevent the spread of deterioration to previously unaffected areas of the concrete.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Some typical sources of problems found in concrete structures are as follows:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stresses generated within the structure itself.
            </li>
            <li>Environmental factors such as climate and pollution.
            </li>
            <li>Exposure to salts and chemicals.
            </li>
            <li>Corrosion of reinforcing steel.
            </li>
            <li>Service temperatures and the resulting thermal cycling.
            </li>
            <li>Failure or deterioration of other components of the structure.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Common problems that are found in concrete structures would be:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stress cracks.
            </li>
            <li>Shrinkage cracks.
            </li>
            <li>Surface spalls or delamination. These can range from very shallow spalls to several inches in depth.
            </li>
            <li>Exposed reinforcing steel.
            </li>
            <li>Galvanic corrosion of the reinforcing steel.
            </li>
            <li>Concrete that is spongy or saturated with contaminants.
            </li>
            <li>Severely weathered concrete.
            </li>
            <li>Rock pockets and/or honeycombed concrete.
            </li>
            <li>Sheared members such as columns and beams.
            </li>
            <li>Lifting and/or settlement of slabs, footers and foundations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are many repair materials on the market today and it is important to select the right product for the job. There are some jobs that
            will require a combination of different materials in order to execute the proper repair. A thorough understanding of the problem’s
            source, the repair materials to be used, installation techniques and job experience are vital to produce a long lasting repair.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Certain things to take into consideration, when faced with a concrete rehabilitation project, would be:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is the repair problem cosmetic or structural in nature?
            </li>
            <li>How extensive is the problem? This may require some non-destructive and/or destructive testing to evaluate the overall condition. In
            certain instances, the services of a structural engineer may need to be employed for safety concerns and specifying the repair design.
            </li>
            <li>How long should a particular type of repair last?
            </li>
            <li>Are the aesthetics of the repairs important? If the repairs are to be made to a finished surface, custom coloring or additional
            surface treatments may be required to “blend-in” the repair.
            </li>
            <li>Does the contractor have experience in performing these types of repairs? A client reference list is always a good idea.
            </li>
            <li>Will it be necessary to interrupt or shutdown access to the areas, while repairs are being made?
            </li>
            <li>Can the repairs be performed in phases, over an extended period of time, to accommodate budgetary restraints?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Some typical concrete repair techniques include the following:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hand Patching
            </li>
            <li>Form and Pour
            </li>
            <li>Epoxy Crack Injection
            </li>
            <li>Hydrophobic Grout Injection
            </li>
            <li>Spray-Applied Mortars
            </li>
            <li>Thin-set Resurfacing - Cementious and Epoxy Mortars
            </li>
            <li>Fluid-Applied Migrating Corrosion Inhibitors
